•	This project proposes an innovative solution to address the growing waste management challenges by integrating real-time waste 
segregation with machine learning. 
A Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, enabling both efficiency and adaptability. 
The system utilizes image recognition and sensor data to detect and classify waste into categories such as recyclable and non-recyclable.

•	A camera captures waste images, which are analysed by a pre-trained machine learning model running on the Raspberry Pi. 
The model’s prediction then triggers a servo motor-powered mechanism to automatically sort the waste into the appropriate bin using a tilting mechanism. 
This approach minimizes human intervention, speeds up waste sorting, and ensures more accurate segregation, which is essential for recycling and sustainability.

•	Additionally, the system’s adaptability allows it to improve through model updates and refinements. 
This scalable solution can be deployed in various waste management scenarios, from homes to industrial facilities, 
contributing to the reduction of landfill waste and promoting recycling.

•	Incorporating sensors can further enhance the system’s accuracy by detecting the weight, 
material composition, or presence of contaminants in the waste, offering a holistic solution that ensures more responsible 
disposal and recycling practices.
